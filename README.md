# Natural Serve Simulation

## Project Description

The **Natural Serve Simulation** is a Java-based project that emulates the dynamics of a simplified natural ecosystem. In this simulation:

- A grid of biomes is created, each containing various types of animals.
- The simulation progresses day by day.
- Animals within the biomes move, eat, and interact with their environment.
- Animal populations decrease due to natural causes or a lack of food.
- The simulation concludes when it reaches day 100 or when all animals have died.

The primary goals of this project are to model the basic behaviors of animals in their natural habitat and to observe how factors like resource availability and animal interactions affect the ecosystem. The simulation provides an opportunity to explore and experiment with various scenarios and observe how the ecosystem evolves over time.

To run the simulation, you'll need Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher and Apache Maven for building the project. Simply clone the repository, build the project, and run the simulation to observe the ecosystem's dynamics.

This project welcomes contributions, so feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance and expand the simulation.
